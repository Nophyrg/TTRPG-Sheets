            <h2>Playing the Scion</h2>
            <p>Shameful, resistant, daring, stalwart. The Scion is the child of a real supervillain, but they won’t let that define them. 
            They’re determined to prove they are their own person by being a greater hero than their parent is a villain, 
            even as the rest of the world paints them with the same brush as their progenitor.</p>
            <p>The Scion is heavily defined in relationship to another character—
            but that relationship is not direct the way it is for the Protégé or the Legacy. 
            The Scion may interact with their villainous parent very rarely during the course of play, 
            but their parent will always cast a dire shadow upon all that they do. 
            Other characters aware of the relationship between the Scion and their parent will always see the Scion in that light, 
            until the Scion successfully “earns” the right to be viewed independently. 
            As a result, when the Scion designs their parent, they are designing an important character for the game as a whole—
            but they are not necessarily designing another member of the main cast.</p>
            <p>Instead, the Scion focuses on particular other characters with their <b>Respect</b> extra. 
            Any name filled into the <b>Respect</b> area of their playbook is immediately flagged as a crucial character to the game as a whole, 
            someone the Scion is interested in interacting with further. When playing the Scion, 
            you should use this extra to aim yourself at the characters and relationships you are most interested in pursuing—
            if you name a character here that you don’t actually care that much about as a player, you’re going to be in trouble.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>Changed sides</b>, you define who is an enemy, but keep in mind that an “enemy” is real opposition—
            not simply someone who is currently in your way, but someone you see as truly opposed to you. 
            The same goes for <b>They don’t deserve forgiveness</b>.</p>
            <p>Also for <b>Changed sides</b>, someone watching (like a teammate) may still doubt your loyalties even on a 10+...
            but on a miss, they have no questions. They come to the worst possible conclusion, and act immediately.</p>
            <p>For <b>All the best stuff</b>, when you define whose cache it is, you should feel free to create a new NPC—
            but try to use existing characters, especially to bolster ongoing relationships.
            The GM is the final arbiter of whether a given character is a “hero” or a “villain”—the judgment is not about perception, 
            but the kind of things they would keep in their cache.</p>
            <p>For <b>Respect</b>, name characters you are interested in spending more time with—
            especially seeing as you will be trying to earn Influence over those characters. 
            Most of the time that you earn Influence over a given character, you do it through the fiction itself, 
            especially by <b>piercing their mask</b> and fulfilling the condition for “How could I gain Influence over you?” 
            That means you’re going to want to spend a lot of time with the characters in your <b>Respect</b> section, 
            seeking them out and trying to impress them.</p>
            <p>Naming a character for <b>Respect</b> means you cannot hold standard Influence over them;
            all of those rules no longer apply with regards to you gaining Influence over them. 
            They can still hold Influence over you, however, and use it in all the standard ways.</p>
