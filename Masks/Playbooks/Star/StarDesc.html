            <h2>Playing the Star</h2>
            <p>Arrogant, ambitious, flamboyant, delightful. 
            The Star is a young celebrity, aware of their status and interested in obtaining more of it. 
            They’re a showboat, but they’re also still a superhero, and those two poles pull them in drastically different directions. 
            Should they make sure they land the last strike on the villain, so they can take the credit? 
            Or should they avoid interfering with their teammate’s fight and possibly messing things up?</p>
            <p>The questions are complicated by your audience. 
            When you play as the Star, your audience is a constant presence intruding upon your life. 
            They will tell you who you are and, more than anything, they’ll try to reshape you into what they want. 
            But they also provide you with help when you need it, when you speak to them or organize them for a particular end. 
            Don’t play the Star unless you’re already interested in interacting with the audience regularly 
            and juggling their impression of you along with actual heroics.</p>
            <p>Remember that your audience is your audience and that, while people may be paying attention to you as part of a team, 
            they’re also paying attention to you individually. That’s another source of fruitful tension for the Star, 
            whether they belong to a team or are an individual celebrity. 
            Play into it, and don’t hesitate to be a bit of a heel sometimes, trying to nab all the attention for yourself.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, always keep in mind that the Star, while a celebrity, is also still a hero. 
            They may be interested in their own popularity quite a bit. They may desperately be trying to stay in the news. 
            But they’re also still ultimately interested in helping people, in making things better. 
            If someone is in pain in front of them, they won’t just let it keep going. 
            If you veer too much into making decisions purely for the audience, then your character will become unsympathetic fast.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>Time for the show</b>, a flamboyant display of your powers needs to primarily be just that—a flamboyant display. 
            It doesn’t trigger if you are using another move, but flamboyantly. If you’re trying to stop a building from falling down,
            but you’re doing it flamboyantly, the move won’t trigger. But if you’re standing on a stage juggling fireballs, 
            then you are doing a flamboyant display, and the move will trigger.</p>
            <p><b>Stage-fighting</b> requires you to fight with an audience watching. “An audience” is more than just a couple people. 
            If you’re fighting in an abandoned warehouse with five hostages watching, then the move won’t trigger. 
            But if you’re fighting in the city streets with news choppers following you, it will.</p>
            <p><b>Cold and cruel</b> requires you to shut someone down. 
            That could involve outright telling them to shut up or it could involve a cold look, 
            but it has to be clear to both parties that you are demeaning, insulting, or reducing them.</p>
            <p>Seeking help from your audience is when you are either putting out a general call for aid from your audience, 
            or searching through people you know to be fans to find someone who can help you out. 
            You aren’t necessarily speaking to the group, so much as combing through them to see if anyone can give you a hand. 
            It takes some time, so it’s unlikely that you can trigger the move in the middle of a fight, unless your audience is right there.</p>
