            <h2>Playing the Janus</h2>
            <p>Stressed, responsible, dual, heroic. The Janus is two people in one, and their struggle is about balancing that paradox.</p>
            <p>You have your regular life and all its responsibilities on one side, 
            and your superheroic life and all its madness on the other. 
            And ultimately, you don’t want to give up either one—but they both pull and pull at you, 
            building up the tension until you feel like you’re going to snap. That’s okay, though. 
            Your story’s all about that tension, and overcoming it, especially thanks to the people around you. 
            Cultivate relationships with NPCs and PCs—they’re all important to your overarching story.</p>
            <p>Pay close attention to your mask. When do you wear it and when do you take it off? 
            Who knows about your secret identity and who doesn’t? For you, more than any other playbook,
            it matters which overt guise you’re in, which mask you’re wearing, and which face you’re presenting to the outside world.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>The Mask</b>, affirming your secret or masked identity means doing something that firmly plants you in that role. 
            Leaving your teammates to go save your sister might affirm you as your secret identity, 
            even while you’re still wearing your mask. Doing the opposite, 
            going off to fight the Blue Hydra instead of rescuing your sister from the Centipede, 
            might affirm you in your masked role. Affirming your identity should always be a meaningful choice or action in the fiction, 
            something with ramifications—good or bad—moving forward.</p>
            <p>For <b>Game face</b>, whether or not you made progress towards your goal is ultimately down to the GM’s discretion.</p>
            <p>For <b>I am what you see</b>,  you can still reject the Label they try to impose on you—
            and you’ll probably have to if you don’t accept it.</p>
            <p>For <b>Mild-mannered</b>, if they buy your facade you’re in no immediate danger of being found out. 
            If you’re still under observation, it means that if you do anything too problematic, 
            you’re likely to get into trouble—they’re watching you. If you leave something incriminating, 
            it means that later you can expect someone to put two and two together and come to find you. 
            If you have to make a fool of yourself, you can expect NPCs to use their Influence to affect how you see yourself—
            and probably inflict a condition.</p>
            <p><b>I’ll save you</b> is ultimately a move for making sure the people from your civilian life are safe at critical moments—
            though it may come at some cost to you.</p>
            <p>For <b>Dangerous web</b>, you don’t actually have to have put the trap in earlier—
            when you trigger the move, it can be the first time that you’ve mentioned setting the trap. 
            It has to fit the fiction—if there’s no way you possibly could have left a trap, then you can’t trigger the move.</p>
            <p>For your <b>Secret Identity</b>, the GM tells you what opportunity or advantage you receive on a hit. 
            When you lapse on an obligation, that means you can expect to get trouble from it in the near future. 
            When your obligations come back to bite you in the butt, they’ll make your life more complicated almost immediately.</p>
