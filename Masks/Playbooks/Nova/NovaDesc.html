            <h2>Playing the Nova</h2>
            <p>Powerful, unrestrained, vulnerable, destructive. The Nova is power incarnate, 
            capable of affecting the world and changing reality on a level their teammates can’t possibly match—
            but that power comes with enormous risk, both to the Nova and to the world around them.</p>
            <p>The Nova’s abilities are intentionally some of the most open-ended of any playbook. 
            They can do nearly anything, though not without difficulty or cost. Chances are, 
            if the Nova wants to do something with their superhuman abilities, 
            there’s a way they can twist their abilities to do that thing—after they <b>unleash their powers</b>, of course. 
            And if they miss when unleashing their powers, 
            the consequences will be much more severe than when the Beacon misses while firing a net arrow.</p>
            <p>The Nova is particularly focused on each moment, each individual problem immediately at hand. 
            They’re so powerful, chances are good that they can at least try to overcome any obstacle with their powers, 
            right then and there. As a result, this isn’t a playbook for long-term planning or preparation. 
            You’re explosive, a battering ram of power. Don’t be too afraid of conditions, because they feed right into your flares, 
            giving you still more power to just make things happen, instantly. But that’s your story—
            balancing the impossible, trying to keep a rein on your power and guide it in the right direction.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>When you charge up your powers, the burn you generate lasts until the end of the scene. 
            To charge up your powers, tell the GM what you’re actually doing, what that looks like for you. 
            If, through charging up your powers, you wind up marking one condition too many, 
            that still takes you out of the scene, just like normal. 
            When you roll + conditions marked, add the total number of conditions you currently have marked to your roll—
            but keep in mind your bonus can’t go higher than +4.</p>
            <p>For <b>Reality storm</b>, if you cause unwanted collateral damage, the GM tells you what it is—
            and you can expect not to like it.</p>
            <p>For <b>Constructs</b>, when you animate a construct independent of yourself,
            you can give it orders and have it take actions. It will obey you. For the most part, 
            the GM tells you the results of anything it does, but the GM might have you make a move through your construct, if appropriate.</p>
            <p><b>Shielding</b> allows you to protect someone in the moment, rolling + Freak to defend. It’s transient and immediate.</p>
            <p><b>Moat</b> allows you to set up a lasting defense in advance, 
            but it won’t necessarily help you right in the moment when your friend is in danger.
            <b>Moat</b> lasts as long as you focus on it and spend more burn when it gets hit especially hard.</p>
            <p><b>Worship</b> allows you to awe an audience in addition to whatever else you do when you unleash. 
            You can <b>unleash your powers</b> specifically to put on the display if you so choose.</p>
            <p><b>Move</b> can refer to teleportation, barreling hard in one direction, or anything else that fits your powers.</p>
            <p><b>Elemental awareness</b> lets you ask the GM any question you want, 
            but it has to be about the place you’re currently in, or elements in the area around you.</p>
