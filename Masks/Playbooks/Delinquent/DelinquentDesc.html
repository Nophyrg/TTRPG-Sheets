            <h2>Playing the Delinquent</h2>
            <p>Rebellious, joking, attention-seeking, manipulative. The Delinquent is the class clown, 
            or the punk with the stash of weed, or the rebel without a cause. They’re the spoiler, 
            most often just because they can be more than out of any particular desire. They trick other people, 
            they mess with people, they cause problems. That said, the Delinquent isn’t an excuse to just be an annoying jerk. 
            They cause trouble because it’s how they get attention, and it’s how they deal with problems—
            but that doesn’t mean they’re without deeper feelings or goals that make them more human.</p>
            <p>The Delinquent veers between being selfish and being a proud member of the team, and their moves point them in that direction.
            <b>Mary Contrary</b> and <b>I don’t care what you think!</b> are both about messing with and ignoring the words of others,
            especially your teammates, while <b>Troublemaker</b> is about helping your team (albeit in destructive ways), 
            and <b>Team? What team?</b> is about both! The Delinquent bounces back and forth over that line, over and over, 
            so play in that space and have fun with it. Remember always that, ultimately, you’re part of this team for a reason—
            you wanted to be here—so simply ditching them all is never an option. (Not least because it means your character would probably retire!)</p>
            <p>The Delinquent works best by sticking close to teammates, one way or another, as much as possible. 
            Whether you’re giving them grief, getting to know them better, or even revealing your true self, 
            your story is ultimately about how you relate to your closest compatriots. You’re the companion, the helper,
            the provocateur, and you make other characters’ lives interesting with your presence. Own it!</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>Criminal mind</b>, you still get +1 ongoing to act on the answers to those questions, 
            just like for a normal assess the situation move.</p>
            <p>For <b>Are you watching closely?</b>, you’re assumed not to get any of the options that you don’t choose. 
            That means if you don’t choose “You confuse them for some time,” then your trick may not last very long. 
            If you don’t choose “You avoid further entanglement,” then you can assume someone’s going to check up on you later about that deception. 
            Getting an opportunity means you get a chance you might not have had otherwise to take action, 
            and exposing a weakness or flaw means you learn something you might be able to exploit.</p>
