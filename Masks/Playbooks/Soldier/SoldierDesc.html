            <h2>Playing the Soldier</h2>
            <p>Devoted, commanding, competent, conflicted. The Soldier is a member of a powerful organization, 
            supported and aided by their resources and personnel, but beholden to their orders and beliefs. 
            Note that the Soldier must commit to A.E.G.I.S., but the other members of the team do not—
            the “new A.E.G.I.S. program designed to keep Halcyon City safe” 
            does not require that the whole team be an A.E.G.I.S.-assembled unit.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the Soldier and A.E.G.I.S. is complicated, but it’s grounded in real support, both ways. 
            When you’re playing the Soldier, you’ve received meaningful help from A.E.G.I.S., 
            and you believe in the organization and its purpose. You’re a part of A.E.G.I.S. because you want to be.</p>
            <p>The question before you is not “What will the last straw be?,” as if the Soldier is guaranteed to break with A.E.G.I.S. eventually. 
            Instead, the question is “How do I balance my own beliefs and morality with that of the organization?” 
            You do not want to leave A.E.G.I.S. If you did, you wouldn’t be a soldier anymore!
            You want to find a way to both keep true to yourself and your beliefs, 
            and to remain a part of the organization that helped you and does good in the world.</p>
            <p>Make sure you keep yourself actually believing in A.E.G.I.S. and its mission.
            If you find yourself refusing every order you get, that’s a sign that something is wrong. 
            Your relationship with A.E.G.I.S. is both the source of your strength and the source of your dramatic tension—embrace it, and play with it.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>A higher calling…</b>, you have a whole other Label—Soldier. 
            “Soldier” here means seeing yourself as devoted, committed, driven, and obedient. 
            Other people see you as a soldier when they think of you as duty-bound and focused,
            or thoughtlessly and dangerously obeisant. 
            You see yourself as a soldier when you think you’re committed and motivated to serve a higher cause.</p>
            <p><b id="emphasis">Acting on orders and relying on your training</b> and 
            <b id="emphasis">asking A.E.G.I.S. for additional resources, equipment, or information during a mission</b> 
            both require all those clauses to be true—meaning that to get A.E.G.I.S.’s aid, you have to be doing A.E.G.I.S.’s work. 
            If you’re not both acting on orders and relying on training, you can’t perform the Label swap to Soldier. 
            If you’re not on a mission for A.E.G.I.S., then asking them for help is as risky as asking anyone for help.</p>
            <p><b id="emphasis">Giving A.E.G.I.S. Influence over you</b> means that it will immediately be able to shift your Labels 
            (seeing that you cannot get rid of A.E.G.I.S.’s Influence without switching playbooks). 
            The GM gets to make that Label shift immediately, from the perspective of A.E.G.I.S. as an organization.</p>
            <p>For <b>Mission first</b>, you must both <b id="emphasis">secure a valuable resource</b> and 
            <b id="emphasis">defeat a powerful foe</b> to trigger the move. 
            Only the Soldier and team have to avoid causing collateral damage to qualify for that clause—
            if the villain causes damage, then that’s just the way it is.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, <b>Before we get started</b> and <b>More than a shield</b> are mutually exclusive—
            most times you cannot closely observe your opposition and head directly into danger without regard for your own safety, both.</p>
