            <h2>Playing the Innocent</h2>
            <p>Hopeful, troubled, out of place, noble. The Innocent is the kid version of a dangerous person, 
            in whom anyone else can see the potential for great nobility...and the potential for great horror. 
            Their story is all about simultaneously being an unformed font of possibility 
            while having clear evidence for a particular life path in front of them.</p>
            <p>Your future self will be a major character in the story from character creation, but early on, they’re liable to be a bit of a flat stereotype. 
            Discovering your future self ’s path is the means by which you make them more and more sympathetic. 
            Always pursue opportunities to learn about that path. 
            After all, who wouldn’t be curious about the events that made their future self into a particular kind of person? 
            If you have the chance to talk to a villain who knew your future self in their early days, do it. 
            If you have the chance to talk directly to your future self, take it. 
            And if ever you feel like something fits one of the steps as listed in <b id="emphasis">Your Future Self</b>, 
            don’t hesitate to circle it.</p>
            <p>If you need a break from the drama of the Innocent, play into the time-lost Innocent.
            There’s a lot of fun and humor to be had in the Innocent being in a strange world, 
            and it’s great for providing an excuse to hang out with your teammates and for getting the Innocent’s Labels shifted, as well.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>You are the ultimate judge of whether you should strike out or circle one of the steps to your future self, 
            but use the GM to help you make your decisions.</p>
            <p>For <b>Growing into power</b>, 
            you explicitly know three things that your future self can do that you can’t from your abilities section, 
            but the move also applies to anything else you’ve seen your future self do over the course of play.</p>
            <p>For <b>What’s this thing?</b>, 
            the GM is the final arbiter of whether or not it goes poorly when you follow the other person’s advice.</p>
            <p>For <b>Martyr</b>, you can easily ensure you take a powerful blow while 
            defending someone any time you roll a 7-9 and choose to expose yourself to danger. 
            You should also remind the GM of this move when you roll a miss on defending someone.</p>
            <p>When you replace one of your basic moves with one from <b>Your Future Self</b>, 
            it means you no longer have access to that basic move. You cannot trigger it. 
            In any situation when you would, either resort to another move if possible, or the GM says what happens.</p>
