            <h2>Playing the Harbinger</h2>
            <p>Fixated, skeptical, searching, damaged. The Harbinger is from the future, 
            and has come back in time to change that future—but the transition has scrambled their memories and their knowledge. 
            Now they have to try to piece together what they came here to fix by remembering who in the present became what in the future.</p>
            <p>The Harbinger makes time travel an important element of the game—
            but does not actually travel through time during the game. They’re not bopping around, 
            and are in fact stuck in this time period. Only their memories will let them get some insight on what is coming. 
            For that reason, “Connecting the dots” is crucial for the Harbinger. 
            You need to fill in a few names in that area of your playbook to have some people to investigate, so go for it immediately, 
            even though you’re rolling at a -1. If you find an NPC you think is interesting, then connect the dots on them!</p>
            <p>Your primary tension is that of the young person driven to make the world better, but not entirely sure how to do it. 
            Most of the other PCs want to do good and make the world better, but they either take situations as they happen,
            or they have guidance from an external force. The Harbinger, however, 
            can actually begin to fill in a picture of what is going to happen, and then take steps to circumvent that outcome. 
            So be proactive! Pursue your attempt to change the future, especially when it conflicts with more immediate threats or goals!</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>Stick to the mission</b>, whether or not someone is “critically important to the future” 
            is in some ways down to your character’s beliefs more than any statement of fact. 
            But you must be able to explain why it is that you think the character in question is critically important. 
            The same idea applies to <b>Applied history</b>.</p>
            <p>For <b>You haven’t learned you can do that yet</b>, 
            you are telling your teammate about something you’ve seen or heard them do in the future. Have fun with it!
            Come up with crazy maneuvers. But you share in the costs and complications of the moves, 
            including marking conditions or being affected by Influence.</p>
            <p>For <b>21st century studies</b>, 
            you can always ask what the future knows about this moment, but the answer might very well be “Nothing.” 
            You can still take a +1 ongoing to act on such an answer if you can make it relevant to your actions.</p>
            <p>When you push yourself to remember for <b>Connecting the dots</b>, the roles are fairly open to interpretation. 
            But once a name is filled in, you can’t erase it (except for the Moment of Truth). For the start of session move, on a hit, 
            you have a lead to follow, while on a 10+, you get some information immediately.</p>
            <p>When you use your Moment of Truth, clear all the names in the <b>Connecting the dots</b> section—
            allowing you to start remembering a new future.</p>
