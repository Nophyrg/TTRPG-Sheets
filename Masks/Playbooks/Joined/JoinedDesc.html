            <h2>Playing the Joined</h2>
            <p>Unsure, supportive, jealous, defiant. The Joined is a mix of emotions and ideas, 
            defined more by the hero to whom they are connected than by anything else. 
            The Joined is different from any other playbook in <b id="emphasis">Masks</b>, 
            and making it work requires substantial buy-in from all the players involved. 
            Don’t play the Joined unless both you and the other player are on-board.</p>
            <p>Both the Joined’s player and their partner player need to be okay with shared uniqueness. 
            You will share in a lot of the same powers and abilities, and in some ways that diminishes the other character’s uniqueness. 
            No one should agree to play your other half if they really want to have sole access to their playbook’s cool stuff.</p>
            <p>Because of the connection between the two characters, creating the Joined is a much more collaborative process. 
            You can’t start the Joined without knowing to whom you are connected, 
            and you should let them finish a lot of the initial steps of their character before you get into the Joined. 
            As such, creating a Joined can’t be a “heads-down” kind of thing.
            Talk to the other player and bounce ideas off each other throughout the process.</p>
            <p>During play, you will obviously spend a lot of time with the character to whom you are joined. 
            But make sure your Joined develops relationships with the other PCs, outside of that primary connection. 
            The story of the Joined moves toward separation and distinction, 
            and you can’t have that story without the opportunity for each half to define themself independently.</p>
            <p>Use locking a Label to mark the moments when your Joined defines themself separately from their other half. 
            Most of the time, locking a Label comes after using a Moment of Truth, 
            so watch out for when you or your other half wants to do that. Remember that when either of you locks a Label, 
            a bond switches to a distinction. If you have no more bonds to switch to distinctions, 
            then you’re already pretty divided—nothing extra happens.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>Your other half</b>, you’re probably going to need to borrow your other half ’s playbook for a bit, 
            to jot down all the relevant information. It may help for you to have a spare copy of their playbook yourself.</p>
            <p>For <b>Fastball Special</b> and <b>Powers, Activate!</b>, you’ll need to say who’s in the lead.
            Go with your gut about which one of you is leading the maneuver. 
            If you and your other half wind up talking too long about it, 
            then that’s the equivalent of giving the GM a golden opportunity—instead of doing your cool maneuver, you’re bickering.</p>
            <p>For <b>Going solo</b>, you really have to engage the threat on your own. 
            If any teammate could potentially spend Team from the pool to help you, then you’re not really on your own.</p>
            <p>For <b>Internal strife</b>, sniping about your other half behind their back requires you to have an audience—
            you can’t just grumble to yourself, under your breath.</p>
