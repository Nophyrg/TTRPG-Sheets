            <h2>Playing the Reformed</h2>
            <p>Haunted, redemptive, dangerous, tarnished. The Reformed is still young, 
            but even in their short time they’ve done things—if not quite unforgivable, then pushing the limits. 
            They filled the role of the villain, and they did it willingly and knowingly. 
            And now they’re trying to do better, to be better, but redemption doesn’t come that easily.</p>
            <p>The key to playing the Reformed is to keep in mind that you’ve already been there.
            You’ve already walked on the dark side. You’ve already done bad things. Not just silly little pranks or tricks, 
            the way the Delinquent might have. You were a villain. And you specifically chose to abandon that life to be better. 
            So while you may be drawn to take criminal action, you’re also trying not to. You’re fighting your base impulses. 
            Your bad habits. Maybe even your addictions.</p>
            <p>That said, your old life wasn’t all bad. Yeah, you aren’t going to rob banks or hurt people anymore, but you made friends. 
            You developed relationships. And you got to know those people the other heroes are all too likely to just dismiss as “villains.” 
            It’s not so easy to just cut all those people and relationships out of your life, 
            especially when they’re trying to pull you back in. 
            Don’t hesitate to go to those characters outlined in your <b id="emphasis">Friends in Low Places</b> for help, 
            even if you are trying to be as noble as possible. Those people have some hold on you, 
            but also you have relationships with them.</p>
            <p>Finally, embrace the conflict likely to come from your teammates mistrusting you, or the world mistrusting you. 
            Don’t play the Reformed if you want to be assured that others are going to see you as heroic. 
            Your teammates and the world at large are all likely to come at you harder than they might for any other character, 
            but that’s what you signed up for.</p>

            <h2>Notes on your moves and extras</h2>
            <p>For <b>What the hell, hero</b>, you get to determine the nature of the injustice you call out. 
            It shouldn’t be just a small perceived slight—the point of the move is to let you accuse more heroic types of wrongdoing, 
            forcing them to perk up and listen because it’s a former villain doing it. 
            They don’t have to agree with you that they committed an injustice, nor does anyone else, when you trigger the move. 
            For ”You win over an onlooker,” at the GM’s discretion this can be interpreted as a crowd of individuals.</p>
            <p>For <b>Dark past</b>, triggering the move allows you to fill in pieces of your past. 
            Don’t confess to crimes that it would make absolutely no sense for you to have done—
            your confession has to be real and true to trigger the move. It also has to be a serious crime. 
            No misdemeanors or small transgressions. Whatever you confess has to have hurt someone in some way.</p>
            <p>For <b>Blowing off steam</b>, the GM is the final arbiter of whether or not the crime actually qualifies for the trigger. 
            As long as you’re doing something illegal, something that you shouldn’t be doing, 
            but that doesn’t directly, obviously, or significantly harm anyone, the move should trigger.</p>
            <p><b>Do me a favor</b> gives you the ability to go to civilian contacts for help. 
            The Reformed is plugged into criminals and villains, and this move may help you ask for favors from those networks. 
            It also allows you to ask for help from people you’ve met in the civilian world.</p>
