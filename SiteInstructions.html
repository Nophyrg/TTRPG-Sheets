        <h2>Saving/Loading Data</h2>
        <p>Fill out the playbook you're using and hit the Save button at the bottom.
        The URL will be populated with a string of text - this is your character sheet converted to JSON and compressed.
        Opening up the page with that URL will prompt it to load the URL and populate the form with the saved values.</p>
        <p>If you make any changes to the sheet, you will have to click save again, generating a new URL.
        I reccomend bookmarking these URL's so you can get easy access to them. 
        Each time you save again, you will have to update the URL of your bookmark.</p>

        <h2>Changing the picture</h2>
        <p>Each character sheet has another field underneath the Name attributes called <i>Portrait URI</i>.
        Click this and it will show the current link to the image being shown 
        (by default this is the pictures hosted on the current site). 
        You can use CTRL+A to select this and replace it with an image of your choice.
        To do so, you will need to get the "URI" of the image - or a link that ends with an image filetype 
        (accepted types are .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .svg).</p>
        <p>There are a variety of ways to upload your own image and get a URI for it. I'll detail two of the easiest ways below.</p>
        <h4>Discord</h4>
        <p>If you send a picture through Discord, it hosts the image on it's own servers, and you can get the URI to those.
        Just click on the image in discord, and click "Open in Browser". 
        The URL this opens in your browser of choice can be copied into the field.</p>
        <h4>Imgur</h4>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a>. You can create an account if you want to, but it's not required to upload an image.
        Click the green button that says "New Post", which will bring you to a site that allows you to upload an image.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT: </b>As soon as you upload an image it will immediately create a link for it. 
        Make sure you want to upload the image to Imgur before choosing one.</p>
        <p>After you've uploaded your image, right click it and choose the option "Open image in new tab".
        The link of the new tab will be the URI you're looking for. Copy paste that into the field.</p>
