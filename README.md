# TTRPG-Sheets
This repository/pages site uses Joe Fulgham's [RPG Character Sheet Tools](https://github.com/joefulgham/Sheet/) for a variety of TTRPG's, especially those using the Powered by the Apocalypse engine. A previous version of this, which was focused on extending the [Masks RPG](https://www.magpiegames.com/masks/) sheets that Fulgham had created (Fulgham's version found [here](https://sheet.adventureforhire.com/masks/)) is copied into this version, in a way that makes it more accessible among the various TTRPGs. The original can be found [here](https://nophyrg.github.io/Masks).
