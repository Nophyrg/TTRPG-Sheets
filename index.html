		<h2>Notes</h2>
		<p>These sheets have been modified by Gryphon M., and were originally created by <a href="https://joefulgham.com/">Joe Fulgham</a> for <a href="https://adventureforhire.com/">Adventure for Hire</a>.</p>
		<p>Most core systems and design choices were made by Fulgham. Gryphon has tweaked them to include some extra fields and add the additional playbooks. 
		You can see the original website <a href="https://sheet.adventureforhire.com/">here</a>, where Fulgham has character sheets for many other RPG's.</p>
		<label>Additionally, below are Fulgham's notes on the Masks sheets.</label>
		<p style="border: 1px solid #4a7284">These sheets are (as of this writing) untested. If you notice any issues, please report them via <a href="https://github.com/joefulgham/Sheet/">Sheet on GitHub</a></p>
